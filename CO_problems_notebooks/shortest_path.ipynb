    "\n",
    "Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with edge weights $w_e > 0$, a source node $s \\in V$, and a target node $t \\in V$, the shortest path problem seeks a path from $s$ to $t$ that minimizes the total edge weight.<sup>[[1]](#ref1), [[2]](#ref2)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate this as an Integer Linear Program with flow conservation constraints, we model the problem on a directed graph $D = (V, A)$. We replace each undirected edge $\\{u, v\\} \\in E$ with two directed arcs $(u, v)$ and $(v, u)$ in $A$, both inheriting the weight $w_{\\{u,v\\}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce binary decision variables $x_{uv} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for each arc $(u, v) \\in A$, where $x_{uv} = 1$ indicates that the arc from $u$ to $v$ is selected.\n",

    "The objective function minimizes the total weight:\n",

    "We impose flow conservation constraints to ensure a valid path from $s$ to $t$.<sup>[[1]](#ref1)</sup> Let $\\delta^+(v)$ denote the set of arcs leaving node $v$ and $\\delta^-(v)$ the set of arcs entering node $v$. The constraints are:\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Graph Symmetries**\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental concept in combinatorial optimization is that of structural symmetry.<sup>[[3]](#ref3), [[4]](#ref4)</sup> Many optimization problems exhibit symmetries that create multiple equivalent solutions, inflating the search space without contributing distinct optima. Understanding and exploiting these symmetries can significantly reduce computational effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *graph automorphism* is a permutation of the vertex set that preserves the edge structure.<sup>[[5]](#ref5)</sup> Formally, let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. A bijection $\\pi: V \\to V$ is an automorphism of $G$ if and only if:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\{u, v\\} \\in E \\iff \\{\\pi(u), \\pi(v)\\} \\in E, \\quad \\forall u, v \\in V\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For weighted graphs $G = (V, E, w)$ where $w: E \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$ assigns weights to edges, we additionally require that the automorphism preserves edge weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "w(\\{u, v\\}) = w(\\{\\pi(u), \\pi(v)\\}), \\quad \\forall \\{u, v\\} \\in E\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all automorphisms of a graph $G$ forms a group under composition, denoted $\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$.<sup>[[5]](#ref5)</sup> The size of this group measures the degree of symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "When symmetries exist, the optimization problem inherits them.<sup>[[3]](#ref3), [[4]](#ref4)</sup> Let $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^{|A|}$ denote the set of feasible solutions. An automorphism $\\pi \\in \\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ induces a permutation on $\\mathcal{F}$ such that if $\\mathbf{x}$ is a feasible solution, then $\\pi(\\mathbf{x})$ is also feasible and has the same objective value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all solutions equivalent to a given solution $\\mathbf{x}$ under the automorphism group is called its *orbit*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\mathrm{Orb}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\{\\pi(\\mathbf{x}) : \\pi \\in \\mathrm{Aut}(G)\\}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The orbits partition the feasible region $\\mathcal{F}$ into disjoint equivalence classes. From an optimization perspective, all solutions in the same orbit are interchangeable. Therefore, the goal is to search over the quotient space $\\mathcal{F} / \\mathrm{Aut}(G)$, finding exactly one representative optimal solution.\n",

    "### **Symmetry Breaking**\n",

    "To prevent redundant exploration of symmetric solutions, we introduce *symmetry-breaking constraints* that eliminate all but one representative from each equivalence class.<sup>[[3]](#ref3), [[4]](#ref4)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common technique is *lexicographic symmetry breaking*.<sup>[[6]](#ref6)</sup> To break symmetry, we impose an ordering on symmetric elements. Consider two symmetric nodes $a$ and $b$ adjacent to the source $s$, with $a < b$ (based on index). Since flow constraints imply that $\\sum_{v} x_{sv} = 1$, we can only select at most one outgoing edge from the source. We add the constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "x_{sa} \\geq x_{sb}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This enforces a lexicographic preference: if the solver chooses to route flow through $b$ (i.e., $x_{sb} = 1$), it requires $x_{sa} \\geq 1$. However, since we can pick only one edge, this configuration is infeasible unless $a$ and $b$ are the same node (or both are $0$). Effectively, this constraint forbids the selection of $b$ if the equivalent option $a$ is available but not chosen, forcing the solver to choose the canonical representative $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, for a set of symmetric nodes $\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k\\}$ adjacent to the source with $v_1 < v_2 < \\cdots < v_k$, we impose the chain of inequalities:\n",

    "A valid symmetry-breaking scheme must satisfy two properties:<sup>[[4]](#ref4)</sup>\n",
    "- *Completeness*: at least one solution from each equivalence class remains feasible.\n",
    "- *Soundness*: the optimal value is preserved.\n",

    "The results obtained in this notebook illustrate the effect of lexicographic symmetry-breaking constraints on the shortest path problem formulated as an Integer Linear Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 1, the diamond graph with $4$ vertices exhibited a single non-trivial automorphism that swaps nodes $2$ and $3$. Without symmetry breaking, the enumeration procedure identified $2$ optimal solutions with cost $2$. The introduction of the constraint $x_{12} \\geq x_{13}$ reduced the solution space to a single canonical path. The reduction factor of $|\\mathcal{F}|/|\\mathcal{F}'| = 2$ coincides with the order of the automorphism group $|\\mathrm{Aut}(G)| = 2$, confirming that the symmetry was fully broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 2, the symmetric ladder graph with $8$ vertices presented a more complex structure with $3$ layers of symmetric node pairs. The enumeration without constraints yielded $2^3 = 8$ optimal solutions, each with cost $4$. Applying the symmetry-breaking constraint $x_{12} \\geq x_{13}$ at the source level reduced the count to $4$ solutions. The reduction factor of $2$ corresponds to eliminating the symmetric choice at the first layer only.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the optimal objective value was preserved. This observation is consistent with the theoretical properties of valid symmetry-breaking schemes: *completeness*, ensuring that at least one solution from each equivalence class remains feasible, and *soundness*, guaranteeing that no optimal solutions are excluded from the reduced space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the symmetry-breaking strategy employed in Example 2 is partial. The $4$ remaining solutions still exhibit pairwise equivalence under the permutations $(4 \\leftrightarrow 5)$ and $(6 \\leftrightarrow 7)$. A complete treatment would require imposing additional constraints at each symmetric layer, as indicated in the results. The systematic construction of such hierarchical symmetry-breaking schemes, as well as the extension of these techniques to other combinatorial optimization problems, constitutes a direction for future work."
